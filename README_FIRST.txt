    🚨 WEEKEND ENGINEER - READ THIS FIRST 🚨
================================================================================

**DATE:** 17 January 2026
**FOR:** Weekend LED eye expressiveness optimization work
**TIME TO READ:** 2 minutes
**PRIORITY:** CRITICAL - Do not start coding before reading this

================================================================================

👋 WELCOME!

You're about to make OpenDuck Mini's eyes the most expressive LED-based robot
eyes anyone has ever seen. This document points you to everything you need.

================================================================================

📖 YOUR MAIN GUIDE

    **FILE:** WEEKEND_ENGINEER_NOTES.md  (in this directory)
    **SIZE:** ~1,400 lines of pure gold
    **CONTENT:**
        ✅ 7 performance optimizations (ranked by impact)
        ✅ Cutting-edge animation techniques from:
           - Disney Imagineering (electromagnet eyes, gaze systems)
           - Pixar Animation (4-axis emotion design)
           - Anki Cozmo (1000+ animation emotion engine)
           - Boston Dynamics Spot (priority behavior system)
           - Columbia University (839ms predictive expressions!)
        ✅ Implementation priority (Saturday/Sunday breakdown)
        ✅ Code examples for every technique
        ✅ 40+ research sources cited
        ✅ Progress log template (track your work)

================================================================================

🎯 QUICK START (5 STEPS)

1. Open WEEKEND_ENGINEER_NOTES.md in your editor
   👉 Read "Quick Summary" section (2 minutes)

2. Jump to "Optimization Priorities for Weekend" section
   👉 See what to build Saturday vs Sunday

3. Start with OPT-1, 2, 3 (Saturday morning)
   👉 These are FOUNDATIONAL - everything else builds on them

4. Run profiling BEFORE and AFTER each optimization
   👉 OPT-7 shows you how to add FrameProfiler

5. Update progress log at bottom of notes file
   👉 Track your timing improvements in real-time

================================================================================

📊 EXPECTED RESULTS

    BEFORE:  28ms/frame (35 Hz) with 10ms jitter
    AFTER:   15ms/frame (64 Hz) with <1ms jitter

    That's 60% FASTER with Disney-quality smoothness!

================================================================================

🛠️ WHAT YOU'LL BUILD THIS WEEKEND

**Saturday (Foundation):**
    - HSV color lookup tables (8ms speedup)
    - Monotonic clock timing (eliminates jitter)
    - Batched LED updates (3ms speedup)
    - Pixar 4-axis emotion system (infinite expressiveness)
    - Micro-expressions (random blinks, breathing)
    - Priority-based behaviors (Boston Dynamics architecture)

**Sunday (Advanced, Optional):**
    - Perlin noise patterns (organic "thinking" animation)
    - Predictive emotion transitions (5× faster perceived response)

**Result:**
    Eyes that feel ALIVE, INTELLIGENT, and EXPRESSIVE
    (unlike any other LED robot you've seen)

================================================================================

⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY RULES

**DO NOT MODIFY THESE FILES:**
    ❌ firmware/src/safety/*        (safety systems are final)
    ❌ firmware/src/drivers/servo/* (servo driver is locked)
    ❌ firmware/config/*.yaml        (GPIO pins are assigned)

**SAFE TO MODIFY:**
    ✅ firmware/scripts/openduck_eyes_demo.py  (your demo script)
    ✅ firmware/src/led_test.py                (test script)
    ✅ NEW files in firmware/src/led/          (create new modules!)

================================================================================

✅ VALIDATION CHECKLIST (After Each Optimization)

    [ ] All 8 emotions still work visually identical
    [ ] No new errors or warnings in output
    [ ] Frame timing improved (profiler shows speedup)
    [ ] Both eyes stay perfectly synchronized
    [ ] No LED flickering introduced
    [ ] Progress log updated in WEEKEND_ENGINEER_NOTES.md

================================================================================

🎬 WHEN YOU'RE DONE

**Record proof:**
    1. Run final profiling (should show ~15ms/frame)
    2. Record 30-second video of eye demo
    3. Save video to: hardware-image/weekend_led_optimization_proof.mp4
    4. Update progress log with final timing results

**The goal:**
    > "Eyes so smooth people think it's running on a microcontroller,
    >  not a Raspberry Pi."

================================================================================

❓ QUESTIONS OR STUCK?

    1. Check "Common Issues" section in WEEKEND_ENGINEER_NOTES.md
    2. Review online research sources (40+ links provided)
    3. Add notes to "Weekend Progress Log" section
    4. If totally blocked, document issue and skip to next optimization

================================================================================

🚀 READY TO START?

    📂 Open: WEEKEND_ENGINEER_NOTES.md
    ⏰ Time budget: 7-9 hours total (Saturday + Sunday)
    🎯 Goal: 50Hz sustained with <1ms jitter

**LET'S BUILD SOMETHING INCREDIBLE!**

Good luck! 🎉
